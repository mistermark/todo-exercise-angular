# Basic Todo app

This is a basic Todo application, where you can add, remove and highlight a specific item as done.

## Main proof points

1. Ensure that the mark-up is semantic. Making use of the proper HTML elements that will fit their original behaviour.
2. Using SASS as a CSS preprocessor. For fonts the Google Font Roboto is used.
3. Javascript must be great, modular behaviour, scalable. Showing awesome code splattering off your screen.
4. Make sure that the TODO application is working fine in IE 9+, Latest Firefox, Chrome and Safari.

## How to use the app

### Add a new item

You can add an item by clicking the ADD button and just hit ENTER (keyboard) after you finished typing into the textfield.

### Completing an item

Simply just click the checkbox in front of the TODO item.

### Remove an individual item

You can remove an individual item by hovering on it and there will appear a TRASH icon behind it, clicking on it will result in deleting it from the task board.

### Remove all items

If you want to remove all items from the task board, just check all items as DONE manually, or by clicking COMPLETE ALL and then click CLEAR COMPLETED.

## Instructions to run the App using Jekyll

### Requirements

1. **[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)** &mdash; requires the Ruby language. If you have a Mac, you've most likely already got Ruby. If you open up the Terminal application, and run the command `ruby --version` you can confirm this. Your Ruby version should begin with `1.9.3` or `2.0.0`. If you've got that, you're all set. Otherwise, follow [these instructions](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) to install Ruby.
2. **[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)** &mdash; The best way to install Jekyll is via RubyGems. At the terminal prompt, simply run the following command to install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`.

### Running Jekyll

Use the command `jekyll serve` in the root of the directory, where the file `_config.yml` resides, and the app should be available at `http://localhost:4000` after it's done starting up.
